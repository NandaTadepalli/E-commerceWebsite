# E-Commerce Static Page

## Overview

This repository contains a static E-commerce web page that I developed during my first year as a B.Tech student. The project was created for a hackathon organized by our college. Please note that this was my first HTML and CSS project, and as a result, the files may not be organized optimally. Additionally, the website may not meet current design standards as it was created during my early stages of learning web development.
